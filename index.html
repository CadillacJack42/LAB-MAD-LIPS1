        <p class="mad-lib">
            This is a face used in many teenage social media pictures. They stick their <span>noun</span> out in a fashion that resembles a <span>animal beak</span>. 
            It is meant to be same <span>adjective</span>, although why anyone would think animal are same adjective, I don't know. Stay away from these girls, 
            prolonged exposure to them may cause medical procedure. This is not to be confused with a kissy face, which is a girl making a face as 
            if she were about to verb someone. This is an okay face under the circumstances that A: She is in a relationship and sending it to her
            noun because she's verb far away B: verb kisses to her 
            mom or dad through skype C: It's holiday. If it is not under these circumstances,
            then it's just as adjective as duck lips.
